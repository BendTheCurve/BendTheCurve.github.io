## About CurveBending
CurveBending is a place for:
- Sharing insights in clean energy, climate finance, and startup
- Discussing ideas about personal growth and development
- Supporting each other in our professional and personal journeys

It's called CurveBending because most changes take place in a non-linear way:
- Climate change hasn't been linear, and global warming only accelerated in the past century; on the flip side, despite the doomsaying, we together can still bend the curve
- Personal development is not linear either. We can grow exponentially, one direction at a time, by staying focused, persistent, and resilient.

## About Me

I grew up in a city called Hefei in China. Lesser known during the time when I was a kid, Hefei is now one of the fastest-growing cities in China and is at the forefront of technological innovation, including clean energy, which is near and dear to my heart.

I moved to Hong Kong when I was 18 and spent most of my adult life abroad since then. Having lived in nearly ten different cities in Asia, Europe, and the US, I developed the most kinship with New York, the city I'd been calling home for almost a decade before my recent move to the Bay Area.

I'm a polymath who embraces both science and the arts. I started coding when I was ten and eagerly competed in the Math & Computer Science Olympics in high school. I switched to studying economics in Hong Kong and spent the next few years meandering in social science subjects. I returned to my technical roots for graduate school and launched my career as a quantitative analyst on Wall Street. I then pivoted into macro-investing, trying to understand how the world works through its mirror image in the capital markets. 

For a while, I struggled to make sense of my path. This changed when l I found my way into climate finance and clean energy: the interdisciplinary knowledge, the global horizon, and the exposure across industries finally intersected and coalesced as I started navigating this complex problem with everything at stake. Starting as a passion, tackling the climate crisis is now my mission.



Day-to-day, I try to keep things simple by focusing on what matters:

- Producing value
- Supporting those I love
- Staying sane



**Welcome to CurveBending.** I hope we get to accompany each other in our journeys of growth and impact.
