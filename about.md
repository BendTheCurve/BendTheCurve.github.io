## About CurveBending
CurveBending is a place for:
- Sharing insights into clean energy, climate finance, and start-up
- Discussing ideas for human growth and development
- Supporting each other in our professional and personal journeys

It's called CurveBending because most changes take place in a non-linear way:
- Global warming was non-linear and lost control only in the last century due to human activities; on the flip side, we human beings also hold the key to bending down the curve.
- Personal development also follows a non-linear path. We can grow exponentially if we stay focused, persistent, and resilient.



## About Me

I grew up in a city called Hefei in China. Lesser known during the time when I was there, Hefei is now one of the fastest-growing cities in China and is at the forefront of technological innovation, including clean energy, which is near and dear to my heart.

I moved to Hong Kong when I was 18 and spent most of my adult life abroad since then. Having lived in nearly ten different cities, I developed the most kinship with New York, the city I'd been calling home for almost a decade before my recent move to the Bay Area.

I'm a polymath who dances between logic and emotions. I started coding when I was ten years old and eagerly competed in the Math & Computer Science Olympics in high school. I then switched to studying economics in Hong Kong and spent the next few years swimming in the ocean of social science subjects. I returned to my technical roots for graduate school and launched my career on Wall Street as a quantitative analyst. I then pivoted into macro-investing for my interdisciplinary curiosity in economics, geopolitics, and the irrational side of the capital markets. I didn't find my way into climate until recent years. Starting as a passion, it's now my mission.

I've used three names in my career: Cissy, Xixi, and Cece. In a way, they represent different stages of my life: Cissy was a fresh grad and newcomer who simply wanted to fit in and find her place in an unfamiliar world; Xixi was a self-assured young woman who finally came to appreciate her Chinese upbringing and unique experience; Cece is an enterprising optimist who is willing to dream big, take risk and fight for what she believes in.

Day-to-day, I keep things simple to stay focused on what matters:
- Do great work
- Support those I love
- Stay sane
