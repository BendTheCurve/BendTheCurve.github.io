## About the Blog
CurveBending is a blog about:
- Sharing insights into energy transition, climate finance, and innovation
- Discussing ideas for growth and development
- Supporting each other in our professional and personal journeys

It's called CurveBending because most changes take place in a non-linear way:
- Global warming was non-linear and lost control only in the last century due to human activities; on the flip side, we human beings also hold the key to bending down the curve.
- Personal growth is non-linear. We can grow exponentially if we stay focused, persistent, and resilient.

## About Me
I grew up in a city called Hefei in China. Lesser known during the time when I was there, Hefei is now one of the fastest-growing cities in China and is at the very forefront of technological innovation, including clean energy, which is near and dear to my heart.

I moved to Hong Kong when I was 18 and spent most of my adult life abroad since then. Having lived in nearly ten different cities, I developed the most kinship with New York, the city I'd been calling home for almost a decade before my recent move to the Bay Area.

I'm a polymath who dances between logic and emotions. I started coding when I was ten years old and did Math & Computer Science Olympics in high school. I switched to study Economics in Hong Kong, which led me to a decade-long exploration of a variety of social science subjects. I returned to my technical root for my Master's program, studying Operations Research at Columbia University. 

I launched my career on Wall Street as a quantitative analyst before pivoting into macro investing. It's a niche but intellectually satisfying field, and I got to explore a broad range of interests: math, data science, programming, economics, politics, and, of course, capital markets. I only discovered my passion for climate until I was a mid-career professional. 

Now specializing in energy transition and climate finance, I feel determined and energized. It's not just a career, it's a mission. We need to make this work. And I want to share this world with you.

I've used three names in my career: Cissy, Xixi, and Cece. In a way, they represented different chapters of my life: Cissy as a newcomer who wants to fit in and find her footing in an unfamiliar world; Xixi as a more confident and self-assured young woman who finally feels comfortable embracing her Chinese upbringing and unique experience; Cece as an enterprising person, who is ready to reinvent herself once again, dream big and make an impact.

I'm Cece. Welcome to BendTheCurve.

## Core Values
I value many virtues but try to keep only three as my core values: none is essential when all are important. They are my inner compass, and I try to follow them as much as I can when making decisions.
- Clarity: have a purpose and know the ‘why’; live life intentionally
- Growth: do meaningful work that fosters personal and societal growth
- Connections: Nurture deep connections, be of service, and bring out the best in people

## What I Focus on Everyday
- Do great and meaningful work
- Support those I love and respect
- Stay sane
