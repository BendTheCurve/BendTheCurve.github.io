# My Transition into Clean Energy
When I started dabbling with a career transition to find 'fulfillment,' I had no idea what that meant.

I had an awesome job as an investor, running a multi-billion portfolio and investing on behalf of institutional clients. It was well-paying, privileged, and intellectually stimulating. I was working with smart and competent people, doing interesting work, well respected by my team and coworkers, and on a promising trajectory to continue leveling up.

There was only one small problem: the mission didn't feel true to my heart. Beating the market didn't excite me as much as it did to many of my peers. I was great at work simply because that's who I am - always delivering and constantly pushing boundaries. But underneath my driven presence, I didn't know what I was fighting for.

Something felt missing. What is it, though? Even more scarily, if not this, then what?


## Facing reality
It wasn't the first time I struggled to find meaning in a career in Finance. In fact, I was haunted by this question my entire tenure. I sought solutions in various ways: making pivots within Finance, taking on expanded roles, being a mentor to others, launching passion projects on the side, recharging my battery through vacations, etc. While these activities distracted me temporarily, none brought sustained contentment.

In fact, they were nothing but distractions. They distracted me from examining my reality and facing the problem straight-on. The reality was that I wasn't happy where I was. As a mission-driven person, I embody my work. Not everyone needs meaning in their work, but I do, unfortunately.

## Growth mindset
Accepting that I had to make a change didn't answer the question of how. I thought Finance was all I knew. I regretted that I didn't explore other fields when I was younger and questioned if I could ever make any meaningful career transition at this age.

I was lucky to have a supportive partner who reminded me of my capability. Not only that, he helped me rediscover the power of a growth mindset, something I knew and agreed with but hadn't embraced fully until then.

Seeing 'growth mindset' in a new light, I learned that:
- Everything is learnable., everything. That includes both hard skills and soft skills, even those touchy feeling skills that people like to call 'natural talent.'
- Failure is to be embraced. Only courageous minds dare to fail because they are taking risks and doing hard things. To grow, we must fail.
- There's no such thing as an imposter as long as we are willing to put in the work to learn and grow.

## Exploration
With the faith that I could learn anything and that it would not be too late, even if I were to start over, I started exploring again. The last time I did this, I was still in college. And over the years, as my career developed and I focused more on 'exploitation,' this almost felt like a forgotten skill. And I had to remind myself of the core framework: iterate quickly, identify the patterns, and move on. The goals were simple: sample a wide range of areas; don't jump to decisions; summarize what I liked and didn't like; build more internal self-knowledge while exploring external possibilities; and last but not least, trust the process.

Within a year's span, I explored multiple domains: data science, product management, venture capital, writing, and blogging. I liked all of them, but none felt like 'it.' However, what I truly learned through the process was about me:
- I realized that I'm more capable than I think, not just in my ability to learn but in my actual experience.
- My job as a portfolio manager actually involves multiple roles: investor, product manager, data scientist, customer success, and sales.
- I value clarity, growth, and connections. I thrive in meaningful work that aligns with these values.

## The lightbulb moment
Things started to click in 2022.\
It was late July in Seattle. I visited Mt Rainier for the first time. For whatever reason, that year, the snow had yet to thaw in July. We only realized it as we saw the mountain up close near the trailhead. It was too late to turn back, so we decided to hike nevertheless. So unexpectedly, a nice and easy summer hike was turned into a strenuous snow hike.

But this turned out to be one of the most memorable experiences of the trip. As we hiked into the mountain, all trails disappeared under the snow. At certain points, there was no trace of human footprints, only white, boundless white, extending into the distant horizon and blending into the sky. Standing in the snow and admiring the mountain in awe, I heard a voice in my head murmuring, 'Maybe my kids will never get to see a snow-covered mountain like this in the future with global warming. We need to do something about this.' That thought has stayed since.

Nature has always been my haven. Mountain, particularly, seems to encompass some special healing power that always soothes my soul. While I never considered myself an environmentalist, I respected and cherished our mother earth deeply.

It was strange that I never drew the connection between this deep passion and my work. Now, looking back, I could see what was missing. I was constraining myself to my past experience, skills, and credentials and not focusing on the problems I cared to solve. I over-indexed on specific job functions and roles and overlooked the bigger-picture, societal-level impact. The idea didn't come to me because I wasn't thinking in the right way.

## Found my path
The capital market plays a pivotal role in fighting climate change. From technology innovation to project development, funding has to go hand in hand. My expertise in Finance is not just relevant but critical. With the northern star in mind, I now needed to narrow down the path.

2022 was the year when ESG entered the mainstream. This was before the whole business turned into a political statement and before 'greenwashing' concern further stirred the scene. Many organizations were launching initiatives to enhance their ESG practice, including my company. Naturally, I started there.

What I learned was similar to what many found out later: that ESG or corporate sustainability, in its current form, is still a compliance and marketing practice. It's a necessary risk management tool but hardly an investment strategy. I have no doubt the field will evolve and play a critical role in the future. However, the change will anchor on policy and regulations, which I'm not interested in getting involved in.

I then turned my attention to clean energy, another area with which I had developed a kinship over the years. I had an interest in the energy industry since college because of the role it plays in human history, economy, and geopolitics. Much of human evolution has centered around energy transition: from wood to coal and then to oil were all remarkable changes that forever altered our human experience. My knowledge was further enhanced as I started trading commodities at work. It was clear to me that clean energy is the future; we're going through the transition at a historical speed, and the capital market plays a pivotal role in accelerating the changes. And with my expertise, I could actually help!

This is it. This is the problem I wanted to help tackle. And this is how I can be a part of the solution.

## Preparing for a change
Almost right away, I started taking action to move in this direction. While I traded commodities and real assets, clean energy wasn't a part of our offering. So immediately, I started my 'intrapreneur' experimentation with a coworker, launching a research project to study the ecosystem, the supply chains, and potential opportunities in the vertical.

I also started taking courses on the side. Despite a foundation in the energy industry, I didn't want to pretend that I had a full grasp of the landscape. I attended a curriculum with Yale, for that matter, to fill the gap and establish a solid foundation in navigating the energy transition ecosystem, from policy to technology to financing. I felt like a kid in the candy store. I was exuded with excitement every day as I learned and grew in this direction.

I also reached out to all sorts of people in the field, from investors to researchers to industry experts, through events, friends, and Linked In. I asked about their work, their day-to-day, the opportunities they are seeing, and the challenges they are experiencing. The information I gathered by talking to people on the ground gave me a more complete picture of the landscape as I enhanced my theoretical understanding of the domain.

Gradually, different pieces started to connect. It became clearer to me where the bottlenecks are and how the capital market can provide help. I also gained clarity on the full capital stack and formed a thesis of the different types of investment needed to address different problems over different horizons. And I knew, as much as I liked being a macro investor, I needed to get down to the project level to further build my expertise on the ground. The idea of investing in renewable energy projects started to crystallize.

Not everyone was supportive. Some said that my investment skills didn’t match, as project finance focuses more on cash flow modeling rather than backtesting and simulation. Some said that I didn’t have enough industry expertise in the energy sector. Some said the opportunity cost for me to pivot at this point in my career was too high. The 20-year-old me would have totally given in to those opinions (in fact, I probably did unconsciously). But this time, I kept going. All the inner work and external exploration prepared me well for the transition: I know who I am and what I want now, and I’m ready to take full agency of my path.

## A new chapter in life
I started preparing to leave my job at the start of 2024 to pursue this new direction full-time. Up until that point, all my exploration was done on the side during nights and weekends. While exhausting, it was totally the right decision: I would be under much more stress without my cushy pay cheque and would very likely settle for a sub-optimal path instead of taking the time to truly figure out my longing and career passion.

I put in my resignation by the end of the first quarter. While I hadn't finalized my next job yet, I was ready. I knew the more time I spent on my old job, the more I was deplaying the change. It was time to take the leap of faith.

And I was right. Within two months, a few offers came, including an opportunity to work for a renewable energy company that I've come to admire since I started exploring the field of clean energy. It was almost exactly the profile I wanted.


It was almost four years ago when I took the red pill and started the journey. It was tough, especially at the beginning, when I had so little knowledge of both myself and how the world really works. Now at the end of the journey, I’m so glad that I persevered. Beyond achieving the goal of finding my career passion, I’m transformed as a human.


So finally, what advice would I give to those who are not content, itching for a change but don’t know where to go next?
- Stop running away from your reality. If you don’t feel content, then you probably aren’t.
- Start exploring. Don’t limit yourself to only work on problems that you think you ‘can’ solve. Work on problems that you want to solve.
- Be introspective as you explore. What makes your heart sing? What mission is worth fighting for?
- It’s ok to be a beginner again. Don’t let it from trying new things. Have faith in your ability to grow.
- Don’t settle for what others see in you. Own your mission and own your path.
- Once you find your path, stay focused, be patient, and keep going.
