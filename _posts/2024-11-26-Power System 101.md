Modern-day power system has intricate design. At the highest level, it has four components: electricity generation, transmission, distribution, and end-user consumption.

In the most centralized form, a utility company owns all three upstream components before electricity reaches the end customers. Such a utility company is called a vertically integrated company, overseeing electricity generation, transmission, and distribution. However, in many parts of the world, including most parts of the US, utility companies only own a part of the system, very often transmission and distribution only. They don't get to control who generates the electricity and how much it costs to generate the electricity. In these cases, the electricity generation is governed through a wholesale market, where many non-utility players, such as independent power producers (IPP), bid into the market and set the price based on market equilibrium. And utility companies provide the 'wire' network to send the electricity from the power plants to the end customers.

This understanding of the power system can help us better contexualize technologies that are taking place under the theme of 'electrification'. Specifically, depending on which part of the power system they serve, most innovations belong to one of these three buckets:

**Generation - which governs the power supply:**

Traditionally, a power plant needs to be plugged into the utility network and go through the utility-owned transmission and distribution lines before reaching the customers, which is known as utility-level power generation. More and more, we're seeing power generation at the additional levels, including both the distribution level and the consumer level. At the distribution level, community solar is an example of how power is generated and connected to the distribution line instead of the transmission line. At the consumer level, more consumers are now generating power directly on-site, known as the 'prosumer,' through the 'VPP' solutions. Residential customers can adopt VPP solutions through residential solar and batteries. An even more fast-growing space is seen on the commercial customer side. Driven by the high growth of AI and data centers, tech companies are tapping into solutions that allow them to power data centers directly through their power generation, very often by co-locating with power plants (even nuclear power plants).

**Consumption - which decides the power demand:**

While most people have no idea how much electricity they use and how that impacts their bills, more companies are working on solutions to make this transparent. This creates incentives for people to shift their load to hours when electricity is in low demand. By doing so, more capacity can be extracted from the existing power system, even assuming all else is equal.

**Transmission and distribution - which connects the two:**

Still owned by the utility, this part of the system, while falling behind in innovation, is pushed to change as the load grows exponentially. More transmission and distribution lines need to be built, period. Lacking that, innovative solutions for managing the system's efficiency while ensuring resource adequacy and reliability are also becoming increasingly critical.
