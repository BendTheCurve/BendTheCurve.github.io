Finally, it’s Thanksgiving weekend!

I’m not a shopping person, so Thanksgiving to me is all about spending time with family and friends, relaxing around food, wine, and good spirit. And like all holidays, things slow down, which provides a perfect cue to pause, reflect, and in this case particularly, be grateful.



I’m grateful for figuring out what I want and finding the courage to take the leap. I got to jump into a different industry and start a new career this year. Every day, I get to learn and do what I care about. More importantly, I know where I’m going next. I have a vision, and I see a path.

I’m grateful for my supportive husband, who supports me in a nonconventional way. By that, I mean his unwillingness to sugarcoat things just to make me feel good. He points me to reality and forces me out of my head when I lose perspective. He pushes me to dream big, think differently, and live up to my potential.

I’m grateful for my health, and specifically this year, for gaining my mobility back. I sprained my ankle last month. As an active person, not being able to move around was extremely frustrating. While still recovering, I can at least move around slowly without crutches now. Despite the injury, I still made it to our offsite retreat in Virginia and got to meet my coworkers, and I was still able to exercise regularly, albeit with much less intensity. Even more so, this accident forced me to slow down and be less attached to my old routine, which is a much-needed lesson especially suited at this stage when tons of changes are setting my daily life on fire.

I’m grateful for my parents, who love me unconditionally, did everything they could to raise me, and are still supporting me in a quiet way. As I plan to be a parent and start to think from that perspective, it’s astonishing that my parents are willing to let me, their only child, live 15 15-hour flight away and only visit them at best once per year. I’m forever grateful for that.

The list goes on.



To me, this list is my source of power and motivation. It is why life is worth fighting for and why our dreams may come true. 

And what are you grateful for?
