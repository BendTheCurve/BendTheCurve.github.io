Methane pyrolysis is a process used to decompose methane (CH4) into its elemental components - hydrogen gas (H2) and solid carbon (C) - without producing carbon dioxide (CO2) as a byproduct. Hydrogen produced this way tends to be known as Turquoise Hydrogen.

Below are a few differences between this technology and electrolysis, which are considered by many to be the holy grail of a ‘green’ hydrogen future.

|                      | Methane pyrolysis                                            | Electrolysis                                                 |
| -------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Carbon Emission      | Produces solid carbon instead of CO2; Indirect emissions from energy used to heat the methane | Indirect emissions depend on the electricity source          |
| Energy efficiency    | Efficiency vary depending on the process: thermal/heating, thermocatalytic, or plasmacatalytic | Generally more energy-intensive than methane pyrolysis       |
| Source               | Uses methane (with potential to use biogas and become carbon neutral/negative) | Uses water                                                   |
| By-product           | The solid carbon can be used in manufacturing (however, most Carbon is sequestered in practice due to the challenge to secure an offtake agreement) | Produces oxygen as a byproduct                               |
| Technology readiness | Currently at pilot scale; Potentially lower cost than electrolysis | More mature technology; Costs decreasing with scale and improved technology |
